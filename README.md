This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ/hub). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

In this challenge I was given the chance to built a small responsive profile card with some social media links, the design was provided by Frontend Mentor.
I faced a few challenges while building this card and Improved while doing It.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Challenge Link](https://soy-ibrag.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-Social-links-profile-Challenge/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of the following:
  - Semantic HTML5: I used meaningful HTML tags to improve both the structure and accessibility of the page.
  - CSS Flexbox: Flexbox was key to making the component layout responsive and easy to center on the page.
  - CSS Units: I utilized different Units for different purposes while building this challenge.

This was a great exercise to solidify my understanding of responsive design principles and basic component-based design.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving on:
  - Advanced CSS layouts: Exploring more complex techniques such as CSS Grid and mastering Flexbox even further.
  - Accessibility: Ensuring that all my projects follow accessibility best practices.
  - Responsiveness: I want to ensure that I adopt good coding habits that overall help with the responsive aspect (such as not using px as much, etc...)
